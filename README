$ bazel build :remote :local

$ cat bazel-bin/remote_version.txt 
/usr/bin/python3.6

$ cat bazel-bin/local_version.txt 
/usr/bin/python3.6

The way to get those to be different is to pin the py_binary to
exec_compatible_with = [":local_python"], but that doesn't work as it can't
find a good C++ toolchain.
