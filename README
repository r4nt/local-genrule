$ bzl build remote_version.txt local_version.txt --toolchain_resolution_debug

$ cat bazel-bin/remote_version.txt 
/usr/bin/python3.6

$ cat bazel-bin/local_version.txt 
/usr/bin/python3.7

This currently works due to to "py_script" having:
exec_compatible_with = [":local_value"]

Removing exec_compatible_with leads to it selecting the autodetecting-python-
toolchain; in case of our TF setup, the remote setup.

The desired behavior is to allow not tagging py_script with
exec_compatible_with, and it still using the local toolchain.
